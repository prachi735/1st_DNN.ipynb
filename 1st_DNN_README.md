# Basics of CNN
Convolution: It means to apply a mathematical operation (sum product of a filter) on a part of input to extract a feature.
Filters/Kernels: Filters are multidimensional array of weights that are applied to a part of data to compute dot product of weights & data.
Epochs: 1 Epoch is said to be complete when we parse through complete data. We do it multiple times to learn more about data.
1x1 Convolution:It is used to reduce the dimensionality of NN & number of parameters to be learned without losing any important information.
3x3 Convolution:It can be used to convolute over any input data. It also can be used to make kernel of any bigger size.
Feature Maps:It is the output of a filter applied to input/layer containing useful information.
Activation Function: Are used to remove certain outputs of a layer and introduce non-linearity to make NN more powerful 
Receptive Field: It is the area over which filter convolutes to get a feature.
